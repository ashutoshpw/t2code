# T2 Connect troubleshooting

A T2 Connect connection goes through four parts, in this order:

1. **This device** reaches T2 Connect over the internet.
2. **T2 Connect** checks your sign-in and the host's link.
3. **The host's tunnel** (cloudflared on the host) carries the request to the host.
4. **T2 Code on the host** answers.

When a connection fails, open **Settings > Connections**, find the environment,
and select **Details**. The first part marked as failed is the cause. Find its
section below.

To see the host's side, run `t2 connect status` on the host, or open
**Settings > Connections** on the host. Both check the host's T2 Connect
address from the host, and say why it fails. `t2 connect` runs the same check
when it finishes setup. This check cannot test another device's network. For a
problem on one device, use **Details** on that device.

## The host's tunnel is offline

T2 Connect could not reach the host's tunnel. This means one of these:

- The host is asleep, turned off, or offline.
- T2 Code is not running on the host.
- The host's network blocks the tunnel. See
  [Port 7844 is blocked on the host](#port-7844-is-blocked-on-the-host).

Fix:

1. Make sure the host is awake and T2 Code runs on it.
2. On the host, run `t2 connect status`. It names the problem on the host's side.
3. If the host was offline for a long time, T2 Connect removes its tunnel. Start
   T2 Code on the host and update it to the latest version. It gets a new tunnel.

## Port 7844 is blocked on the host

The tunnel on the host connects out to Cloudflare on port 7844, with TCP and
UDP. Both tunnel protocols (QUIC and HTTP/2) use this port. When the host's
network blocks it, the tunnel cannot start, but normal web traffic still works.
The host looks online, so this problem is easy to miss.

Common causes:

- **A Tailscale exit node on the host.** All of the host's internet traffic goes
  through the exit node, and that network blocks port 7844. Turn off the exit
  node on the host with `tailscale set --exit-node=`, or allow outbound port
  7844 on the exit node's network.
- **A VPN on the host.** Work VPNs often block unknown ports. Ask for port 7844
  to be allowed, or use a direct route instead (see below).
- **A firewall or strict network.** Allow outbound TCP and UDP port 7844.

If you cannot unblock the port, you can connect without T2 Connect. When the
host and this device are on the same Tailscale network, add the host's
Tailscale address as a direct route. See
[Reach one machine several ways](./remote-access.md#reach-one-machine-several-ways).

## The tunnel works, but T2 Code does not answer

The host's tunnel is up, but it cannot reach T2 Code on the host. Common causes:

- T2 Code on the host stopped, crashed, or is still starting.
- T2 Code restarted on a different port, for example after an update, and the
  tunnel still points at the old port.
- The server binds only one network address with `T2CODE_HOST`. The tunnel
  sends requests to `127.0.0.1`, so the server must also listen there.

Fix: restart T2 Code on the host. For the background service, run
`t2 service restart`. Then run `t2 connect status` on the host.

## The T2 Connect address does not resolve or answer

The host's T2 Connect address did not resolve, refused the connection, failed a
secure (TLS) connection, or did not answer in time.

Fix:

1. Make sure the host is awake and online.
2. On the host, run `t2 connect status`.
3. If the check fails only on the host, check the host's DNS, VPN, or proxy.

## This device can't reach T2 Connect

The problem is on this device's network, not on the host. This device could
not reach T2 Connect, or it reached T2 Connect but not the host's tunnel
address.

Fix:

1. Check this device's internet connection. On a captive or dead Wi-Fi network,
   the device can look online but cannot reach anything.
2. A VPN, firewall, ad blocker, or DNS filter on this device can block T2
   Connect. Turn it off for a moment to test.
3. On iPhone, Connectivity Assist in the Wi-Fi settings can break T2 Connect.
   Turn it off to test.
4. Try another network, or add a direct route to the host, such as its
   Tailscale address. See
   [Reach one machine several ways](./remote-access.md#reach-one-machine-several-ways).

## Sign-in, account, or link problems

T2 Connect does not have an active link between your account and the host.

- **The host is linked to a different account.** Sign in to the same T2 Connect
  account on this device and on the host. On the host, run `t2 connect logout`,
  then `t2 connect`.
- **T2 Connect is off on the host, or the host only publishes agent activity.**
  On the host, open **Settings > Connections** and turn **T2 Connect** on, or
  run `t2 connect`.
- **The host was linked, but the server did not apply the link yet.** Run
  `t2 service restart` on the host, or restart `t2 serve`.
- **This device's sign-in expired, or the host no longer accepts this
  device.** Sign out of T2 Connect and sign in again.
- **Your account reached its tunnel limit.** Remove an environment you do not
  use from your T2 account's T2 Connect page, then restart T2 Code on the host.

## The clock is off

T2 Connect signs requests with short-lived proofs. When the clock on this
device or the host is a few minutes wrong, T2 Connect rejects them. Turn on
automatic date and time on both devices, then retry.

## The host runs an older T2 Code

This app needs a newer T2 Code on the host. Update T2 Code on the host. See
[Updating T2 Code](./updating.md).

After you fix a permanent rejection, restart the host's server with
`t2 service restart`. For a foreground server, stop it and run `t2 serve` again.

If T2 Code on the host disappears when SSH closes, see
[background-service troubleshooting](./background-service.md#troubleshooting).
